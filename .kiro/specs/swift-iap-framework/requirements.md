# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document defines the requirements for a modern Swift In-App Purchase (IAP) framework. The framework will provide comprehensive IAP functionality, supporting iOS 13+ systems, using Swift 6.0+ and Swift Concurrency, while being compatible with both StoreKit 1 and StoreKit 2 APIs. The framework will adopt a modular design, support both UIKit and SwiftUI, and include complete test coverage and anti-loss mechanisms to ensure no purchases are lost.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to be able to load and manage product lists, so that I can display purchasable content to users.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN developer provides product ID list THEN framework SHALL asynchronously load corresponding product information
2. WHEN using iOS 15+ THEN framework SHALL use StoreKit 2's Product API
3. WHEN using iOS 13-14 THEN framework SHALL use SKProductsRequest and wrap it as async/await through withCheckedContinuation
4. WHEN product loading fails THEN framework SHALL return specific error information
5. WHEN product loading succeeds THEN framework SHALL return product objects containing complete information including price and description

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to be able to handle different types of product purchases, so that I can support various business models.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN user initiates purchase request THEN framework SHALL support non-consumable, consumable, and subscription products
2. WHEN purchase process begins THEN framework SHALL use Swift Concurrency for asynchronous processing
3. WHEN using iOS 15+ THEN framework SHALL use StoreKit 2's Transaction API
4. WHEN using iOS 13-14 THEN framework SHALL use SKPaymentQueue and wrap it as async/await
5. WHEN purchase succeeds THEN framework SHALL return transaction information and receipt data
6. WHEN purchase fails THEN framework SHALL return detailed error reasons

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to be able to restore users' historical purchases, so that users can regain purchased content on new devices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN user requests purchase restoration THEN framework SHALL asynchronously query user's historical purchase records
2. WHEN purchase restoration succeeds THEN framework SHALL return all valid historical transactions
3. WHEN purchase restoration fails THEN framework SHALL return specific error information
4. WHEN during restoration process THEN framework SHALL ensure all transactions are properly processed and completed

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to be able to validate purchase receipts, so that I can ensure transaction authenticity and security.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN receiving purchase receipt THEN framework SHALL provide local validation functionality
2. WHEN remote validation is needed THEN framework SHALL provide extensible remote validation interface
3. WHEN validation succeeds THEN framework SHALL return validation results and transaction details
4. WHEN validation fails THEN framework SHALL return validation error information

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the framework to have anti-loss mechanisms, so that user purchases won't be lost due to network issues or application crashes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN application starts THEN framework SHALL automatically monitor all unfinished transactions
2. WHEN unfinished transactions are discovered THEN framework SHALL automatically retry processing
3. WHEN transaction processing fails THEN framework SHALL implement exponential backoff retry mechanism
4. WHEN transaction queue changes THEN framework SHALL monitor in real-time and handle all state changes
5. WHEN user disconnects or application exits unexpectedly THEN framework SHALL resume processing flow on next startup

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the framework to support strict Swift Concurrency checking, so that I can ensure thread safety of the code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN compiling code THEN framework SHALL enable strict Swift Concurrency checking
2. WHEN handling UI updates THEN framework SHALL correctly use @MainActor annotation
3. WHEN passing data THEN framework SHALL ensure all types conform to Sendable protocol
4. WHEN executing asynchronous operations THEN framework SHALL use async/await instead of callbacks

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the framework to support both UIKit and SwiftUI, so that I can use it in different types of projects.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN used in UIKit projects THEN framework SHALL provide UIKit-compatible calling methods
2. WHEN used in SwiftUI projects THEN framework SHALL provide SwiftUI-compatible calling methods
3. WHEN UI updates are needed THEN framework SHALL ensure execution on main thread
4. WHEN providing example code THEN framework SHALL include complete usage examples for both frameworks

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the framework to have comprehensive error handling and localization support, so that I can provide a good user experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN errors occur THEN framework SHALL provide detailed error types and descriptions
2. WHEN user prompts are needed THEN framework SHALL support localized error messages
3. WHEN debugging applications THEN framework SHALL provide detailed debugging information
4. WHEN errors occur THEN framework SHALL implement LocalizedError protocol

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the framework to have comprehensive test coverage, so that I can ensure code quality and reliability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN writing tests THEN framework SHALL use protocol abstractions for key dependencies
2. WHEN testing purchase flows THEN framework SHALL provide Mock and Stub classes
3. WHEN testing asynchronous operations THEN framework SHALL support Swift Concurrency testing
4. WHEN running tests THEN framework SHALL cover all core functionality
5. WHEN testing failure scenarios THEN framework SHALL verify error handling logic

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the framework to be available as a Swift Package, so that I can easily integrate it into projects.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating Package.swift THEN framework SHALL define correct module structure
2. WHEN setting dependencies THEN framework SHALL support iOS 13+ and Swift 6.0+
3. WHEN importing framework THEN framework SHALL provide clear public API
4. WHEN using framework THEN framework SHALL not depend on external third-party libraries
