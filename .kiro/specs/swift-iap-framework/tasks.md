### ðŸ“‹ Implementation Notes

This implementation plan builds upon the existing Swift IAP Framework codebase and adds server-side order management capabilities. The tasks are designed to:

1. **Maintain Backward Compatibility**: Existing APIs will continue to work while new order-based APIs are added
2. **Incremental Implementation**: Each task builds upon previous tasks and can be implemented incrementally
3. **Comprehensive Testing**: Each major component includes corresponding test implementation
4. **Error Handling**: Robust error handling for all order-related operations
5. **Documentation**: Complete documentation updates for new functionality

The implementation follows the established patterns in the existing codebase and maintains the same level of quality, testing, and documentation standards.
